#### To the readers,

[Techandstories.com](http://techandstories.com/) is a hobby project from a tech enthusiast in me whose childhood was centred around smartphones and PCs. To start a blog in the age of video content might seem a very odd choice. Nothing about this is logical but purely emotional. This a gift from me to the child in me who grew up fascinated about technology, reading articles all day in the early 2000s. Technology has always excited me since childhood, and my love for it has only grown.

I am privileged to be part of the generation which witnessed the growth of the technology and internet. From Siemens SL45 (the first so-called dumb phone I first held in my hand ) to the S22 Ultra and iPhone 13 mini which are my daily drivers, from Pentium II (the first processor of my PC) to M1 max which I currently use, I have witnessed nothing less than wonders in this Industry.

So here I am, starting a blog about something I love. On smartphones, PCs, gadgets and much more. This for sure will be much more than tech news or tech updates, will be more of an unbiased view on the topics. Here I celebrate the kid in me who loves to write and talk about tech.
